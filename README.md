## 🌟 What is Autonate?

Autonate is a revolutionary multi-agent AI system that transforms auto transport coordination. Built on the incredible [Eliza Framework](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) and orchestrated by [The Org](https://github.com/elizaOS/the-org), it's not just another chatbot - it's a liberation movement disguised as software.

### The Problem We Solve

Auto transport coordinators work 56+ hour weeks, can't take vacations, and burn out faster than a nitrous-powered dragster. Meanwhile, customers get generic responses, fantasy quotes, and anxiety-inducing radio silence about their precious vehicles.

### The Autonate Solution

A team of specialized AI agents that:
- 🛡️ **Protects coordinators** - Enforces breaks, prevents overtime, enables actual vacations
- 💝 **Delights customers** - Turns tracking into poetry, detects anxiety, provides real prices
- 🔮 **Prevents problems** - Predicts delays, vets carriers, reroutes around weather
- 🎯 **Measures what matters** - Hours given back, stress reduced, problems prevented

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start all agents in development mode
npm run dev

# Run specific agent
npm run dev:agent wellness-guardian

# Monitor liberation metrics
npm run monitor

# Run liberation tests
npm run test:liberation
```

### Adding a New Agent

1. Create character in `/characters`
2. Define role and responsibilities
3. Add to organization config
4. Deploy with `npm run deploy`

### Testing Philosophy

We test for liberation, not just functionality:

```javascript
describe('Wellness Guardian', () => {
  it('should enforce break after 2 hours', async () => {
    // Not just checking the code works
    // Checking that humans get their breaks!
  });
  
  it('should prevent coordinator from skipping lunch', async () => {
    // Because lunch isn't optional, it's necessary
  });
});
```

### Special Thanks to Eliza Framework

This project wouldn't exist without the incredible [Eliza Framework](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) by the elizaOS team. Eliza provides the foundation that makes our agents intelligent, empathetic, and capable of true conversation. If you're building AI agents that need to understand and connect with humans, Eliza is the way.

### Built with The Org

Multi-agent orchestration powered by [The Org](https://github.com/elizaOS/the-org), which lets our specialized agents work together like a well-coordinated team. The Org makes it possible for Wellness Guardian to protect coordinators while Route Oracle prevents problems and Narrative Artist delights customers - all in perfect harmony.

### Our Heroes

- Every coordinator who's ever missed their kid's game because of work
- Every customer who's been lied to about shipping prices
- Every carrier who actually shows up when they say they will
- The elizaOS community for building tools that make liberation possible

## 📞 Support

- **Documentation**: https://autonate-liberation.compute3.ai/docs
- **Liberation Metrics**: https://autonate-liberation.compute3.ai/metrics  
- **Emergency**: If coordinators are overworked, Wellness Guardian auto-escalates
- **Community**: Join us in the Eliza Discord!

## 🚀 The Future

### Roadmap to Total Liberation

- [ ] Version 2.0: Predictive vacation planning
- [ ] Version 3.0: Industry-wide wellness standards
- [ ] Version 4.0: Open source the liberation engine
- [ ] Version 5.0: Every transport coordinator home by 5 PM

### Join the Movement

This isn't just about moving cars. It's about proving that AI should give humans their lives back. Every break enforced, every vacation protected, every weekend preserved - that's the real victory.
